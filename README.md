# Digital Laboratory Power Supply

#### This project was done when I was 11th grade(2019). The main idea was to create an Power Supply which was controlled programmatically.
#### UI was written in C#. By that time I was not so good at programming. So the code may look like spaghetti.

## It was presented in ICT Week (2019) which was held in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. 
### My infinite thanks to my greatest mentor who taught me not only electronics but also taught the rules of Life
